# D Tech

_D Tech_ is the name of my 2D game engine.

The name is a lame pun on [id Tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech). I apologise.

Documentation is currently non-existent. I apologise.

Third-party libraries used:

* [HUMP](http://vrld.github.io/hump/) for gamestate management and signaling
* [HardonCollider](http://vrld.github.io/HardonCollider/) for collision detection (I am sorry for the name)
* [SLAM](https://github.com/vrld/slam) for improved sound handling
